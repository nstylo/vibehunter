InputSystem.ts
Captures WASD / dash (via Phaser’s EventEmitter)

Maintains inputSeq counter; packs & appends to per-frame buffer

sendBufferedInputs() called each GameScene.update()

NetworkSystem.ts
WebSocket wrapper

Outgoing – join, input, ping

Incoming – state, gameOver, pong

Emits events to scenes & systems (onState, onHud, onDisconnect)

Tracks RTT; exposes getPing() for HUD

PredictionSystem.ts
Keeps circular buffer of last N snapshots

Linear-interpolates entities based on render time (serverTime − 100 ms cushion)

On misprediction (player pos delta > ε), “rewinds” local sprite smoothly over 1–2 frames

AudioSystem.ts
Map of event → sound key – pulled in scenes and objects

2-D sounds (volume pan by world X coordinate)

Mute / unmute persists to localStorage
